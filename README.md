- 👋 Hi, I’m Dana
- 👀 I’m interested in reading and movies
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about using Windows Event Logs, Performance Monitor, Local Security Policy, and .NET FileWatcher to monitor processes and file system files/folders.
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on any projects right now. I am just learning the GitHub system.
